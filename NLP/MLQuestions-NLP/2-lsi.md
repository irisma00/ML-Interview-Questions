This, LSI, model helps us understand and classify words with similar contextual meanings within large data sets.

Developed in the 1980s, LSI uses a mathematical method that makes information retrieval more accurate. This method works by identifying the hidden contextual relationships between words. It may help you to break it down like this:

Latent → Hidden
Semantic → Relationships Between Words
Indexing → Information Retrieval

## How does Latent Semantic Indexing Work?

LSI works using the partial application of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is a mathematical operation that reduces a matrix to its constituent parts for simple and efficient calculations. 

When analysing a string of words, LSI removes conjunctions, pronouns, and common verbs, also known as stop words. This isolates the words which comprise the main ‘content’ of a phrase. Here’s a quick example of how this might look:

These words are then placed in a Term Document Matrix (TDM). A TDM is a 2D grid that lists the frequency that each specific word (or term) occurs in the documents within a data set.

Weighing functions are then applied to the TDM. A simple example is classifying all documents that contain the word with a value of 1 and all that don’t with a value of 0. When words occur with the same general frequency in these documents, it is called co-occurrence. 

## LSA
Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in particular distributional semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms. LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text (the distributional hypothesis). A matrix containing word counts per document (rows represent unique words and columns represent each document) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns. Documents are then compared by cosine similarity between any two columns. Values close to 1 represent very similar documents while values close to 0 represent very dissimilar documents
